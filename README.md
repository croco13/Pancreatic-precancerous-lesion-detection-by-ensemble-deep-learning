The objective of this project is to develop an AI application that utilizes deep learning  algorithms to accurately identify intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) from  microscopic images.

This project aims to develop an AI application using deep learning algorithms to accurately identify intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) from microscopic images. Two types of datasets are used: one for binary segmentation (IPMN vs. NOT IPMN) and another for three-class segmentation (IPMN, non-IPMN pancreatic structures, and background). Each dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets.

Three deep learning models; DeepLabV3, Attention-UNet, and SegResNet are utilized, along with an ensemble model that combines the predictions of these three models to enhance segmentation performance. The ensemble model aims to leverage the strengths of each individual model to improve overall accuracy and robustness.

The provided code is configured to handle both binary (2 classes) and multi-class (3 classes) segmentation tasks. To switch between the two, users only need to modify the "number of classes" parameter and supply the appropriate dataset. The code dynamically adapts to the chosen segmentation task by adjusting the input data and model parameters accordingly. The data preparation process involves importing necessary libraries, converting segmentation masks into a format compatible with the models, applying transformations, etc... Custom functions and classes are implemented to manage data loading, training, and evaluation, ensuring the models are trained efficiently. During training, the models are evaluated based on key performance metrics, such as Intersection over Union (IoU), accuracy, and F1 score. The ensemble approach further refines these results, particularly for the three-class segmentation task, where it demonstrates superior performance. For binary segmentation, the models are optimized using a combination of deep learning techniques and morphological operations.

The code is designed to be flexible and easily adaptable, allowing to modify parameters and datasets to suit different segmentation tasks, thereby facilitating the development of robust and accurate diagnostic tools in digital pathology.
